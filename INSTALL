BAT - Bayesian Analysis Toolkit
version 0.9.3
-------------------------------

This is the INSTALL file of BAT package
---------------------------------------
You can find here a short description of what to do to be able to
compile and use BAT on your computer.


Platforms
----------
BAT has been developed on Linux machines running different distributions
and different versions of the kernel and gcc. As far as we know there
is nothing distribution dependent inside of BAT. However, we have not yet
started to systematically check for compatibility and portability. This is
planned for future releases of BAT. For the moment the only statement
we can make is that if you don't have a too old or too specific
installation of Linux you should be able to compile and use BAT without
problems.

The installation and functionality of BAT has also been tested on MAC OS X.

Windows is not supported for the moment.

Dependencies
-------------
ROOT:
   ROOT is an object oriented data analysis framework. You can obtain
   it from http://root.cern.ch/. Since BAT version 0.4.2 a ROOT version
   5.22 or later is needed to compile and run BAT. Please, check your
   linux distribution for the availability of precompiled packages on
   your system. Mostly used distributions nowdays have the ROOT packages
   available.

Note: To be able to use the interface to RooFit/RooStats the ROOT version
      5.27/04 or later is necessary and ROOT has to be compiled with
      MathMore enabled.

Recommended
-----------
CUBA:
   CUBA is a library containing general purpose multidimensional
   integration algorithms. It can be obtained from
   http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/. BAT will compile and run with Cuba
   version 3.2 or later. Cuba is not necessary to run BAT, however, its
   use is recommended as it provides integration routines tuned for
   performance, which are very usefull for integration in problems with
   large number of dimensions.

Installation Procedure
----------------------
Unpack the tarball containing the BAT source usually named like
BAT-x.x.tar.gz (here x.x is the version number) using command

    tar -xzf BAT-x.x.tar.gz

A directory called BAT-x.x will be created containing the source code.
Enter the directory and run the configuration using commands

    cd BAT-x.x
    ./configure

This will check your system for all components needed to compile BAT
and set up the paths for installation. You can add option
--prefix=/path/to/install/bat to ./configure to specify the the prefix
to the BAT installation path. The BAT library files will be installed
to $prefix/lib and the include files to $prefix/include. Default
installation prefix is /usr/local.

The configure script checks for ROOT availability in the system and
fails if ROOT is not installed. You can specify the ROOTSYS directory
using --with-rootsys=/path/to/rootsys.

You can configure BAT with the RooFit/RooStats support using
--with-roostats. The configure script will check whether the version of
ROOT is sufficient and whether the ROOT was compiled with RooFit/RooStats
support.

Support for openMP threading to run multiple Markov chains in parallel
is available through the configure option --enable-parallelization; it
is disabled by default. This requires a version of gcc accepting the
-fopenmp flag, anything >= 4.2 should suffice.  Note that if threads
are enabled, the default number of threads actually used is
implementation dependent and may also depend on the current load of
the CPU. Manual control over the number of threads is achieved
entirely by openMP means such as setting the enviroment variable
OMP_NUM_THREADS before running an executable.

You can compile BAT with Cuba support using option --with-cuba[=DIR].
The configure script will then search for libcuba.a and cuba.h in the
system paths, or, if DIR is given, in DIR (correct if cuba just
compiled in its source directory), and in DIR/lib/ and DIR/include/
subdirectories. For more fine-grained control, use
--with-cuba-include-dir=/path/to/cuba/header and
--with-cuba-lib-dir=/path/to/cuba/lib.

Note that the cuba library still needs to be available to the loader
at runtime. This is accomplished, for example, by adding
/path/to/cuba/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Please compile the Cuba library
with position-independent code. For example
./configure CFLAGS='-fPIC -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -Wall'
to avoid linker errors like
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libcuba.a(Vegas.o): relocation R_X86_64_32
against `.rodata.str1.8' can not be used when making a shared object;
recompile with -fPIC

You can list all available options using

    ./configure --help

After successful configuration run

    make
    make install

to compile and install BAT. Note that depending on the setting of
installation prefix you might need root priviledges to be able to install
BAT and run 'sudo make install' instead of plain 'make install'. If you
are installing BAT e.g. in your $HOMEDIR, you need to add the path to the
library and to the include files to the search path in your system.
Depending on your shell you can do that e.g. via commands

    export BATINSTALLDIR=/bat/install/prefix
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/lib
    export CPATH=$CPATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/include

or

    setenv BATINSTALLDIR     /bat/install/prefix
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH   $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/lib
    setenv CPATH             $CPATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/include

for bash and csh compatible shells, respectively. On Mac OS X you might
also need to setup DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

An option for use in compiled programs would also be to add
-I/bat/install/include/path to CXXFLAGS and -L/bat/install/lib/path to
LDFLAGS in your Makefile. However, the interactive ROOT macros will not
work if libBAT.so, libBATmodels.so, libBATmtf.so, libBATmvc.so,
libBAT.rootmap, libBATmodels.rootmap, libBATmtf.rootmap and libBATmvc.rootmap
are not in the system library search path.
