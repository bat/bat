This is the INSTALL file of BAT package
---------------------------------------
You can find here a short description of what to do to be able to
compile and use BAT on your computer. In the future a detailed
description should become a part of the manual.


Platforms
----------
BAT has been developed on Linux machines running different distributions
and different versions of the kernel and gcc. As far as we know there
is nothing distribution dependent inside of BAT. However, we have not yet
started to systematically check for compatibility and portability. This is
planned for future releases of BAT. For the moment the only statement
we can do here is that if you don't have a too old or too specific
installation of Linux you should be able to compile and use BAT without
problems.

Windows is not supported for the moment.

Dependencies
-------------
ROOT:
   ROOT is an object oriented data analysis framework. You can obtain
   it from http://root.cern.ch/. To compile and run BAT you will need
   a ROOT version 5.16 or later. Please, check your linux distribution
   for the availability of precompiled packages on your system. Mostly
   used distributions nowdays have the ROOT packages available.

Recommended
-----------
CUBA:
   CUBA is a library containing general purpose multidimensional
   integration algorithms. It can be obtained from
   http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/. Cuba is optional extension to BAT. You
   will be able to compile and install BAT without Cuba. However, the
   use of Cuba is recommended as it provides integration routines tuned
   for performance, which are very usefull for integration in problems
   with large number of dimensions.

   Note: To compile CUBA libraries use command 'make lib' instead of plain
         'make' since it tries to compile MathLink executables and fails if
         MathLink is not installed on the system. You may need to copy the
         libcuba.a and cuba.h to the appropriate locations on your system
         by hand as the 'make install' will fail if MathLink executables
         are not comiled.

Installation Procedure
----------------------
Unpack the tarball containing the BAT source usually named like
BAT-x.x.tgz (here x.x is the version number) using command

    tar -xzf BAT-x.x.tgz

A directory called BAT-x.x will be created containing the source code.
Enter the directory and run the configuration using commands

    cd -x.x
    ./configure

This will check your system for all components needed to compile BAT
and set up the paths for installation. You can add option
--prefix=/path/to/install/bat to ./configure to specify the the prefix
to the BAT installation path. The BAT library files will be installed
to $prefix/lib and the include files to $prefix/include. Default
installation prefix is /usr/local.

The configure script checks for ROOT availability in the system and
fails if ROOT is not installed. You can specify the ROOTSYS directory
using --rootsys=/path/to/rootsys.

The configure will also search for libcuba.a and cuba.h in the system.
The libcuba.a has to be available in the standard system library search
path. You can specify the cuba.h location using
--with-cuba-path=/path/to/cuba/header.

After successful configuration run

    make
    make install

to compile and install BAT. Note that depending on the setting of
installation prefix you might need root priviledges to be able to install
BAT. If you are installing BAT e.g. in your $HOMEDIR, you need to add
the path to the library and to the include files to the search path
in your system. Depending on your shell you can do that via commands

    export BATINSTALLDIR=/bat/install/prefix
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/lib
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/include

or

    setenv BATINSTALLDIR       /bat/install/prefix
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH     $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/lib
    setenv CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH  $CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/include

for bash and csh compatible shells, respectively.
