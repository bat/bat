BAT - Bayesian Analysis Toolkit
version 0.4.X
-------------------------------

This is the INSTALL file of BAT package
---------------------------------------
You can find here a short description of what to do to be able to
compile and use BAT on your computer. In the future a detailed
description should become a part of the manual.


Platforms
----------
BAT has been developed on Linux machines running different distributions
and different versions of the kernel and gcc. As far as we know there
is nothing distribution dependent inside of BAT. However, we have not yet
started to systematically check for compatibility and portability. This is
planned for future releases of BAT. For the moment the only statement
we can make is that if you don't have a too old or too specific
installation of Linux you should be able to compile and use BAT without
problems.

The installation and functionality of BAT has also been tested on MAC OS X.

Windows is not supported for the moment.

Dependencies
-------------
ROOT:
   ROOT is an object oriented data analysis framework. You can obtain
   it from http://root.cern.ch/. To compile and run BAT you will need
   a ROOT version 5.16 or later. Please, check your linux distribution
   for the availability of precompiled packages on your system. Mostly
   used distributions nowdays have the ROOT packages available.

Note: To be able to use the interface to RooFit/RooStats the ROOT version
      5.24 or later is necessary.

Recommended
-----------
CUBA:
   CUBA is a library containing general purpose multidimensional
   integration algorithms. It can be obtained from
   http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/. In this version BAT no longer depends
   on CUBA and you can compile and run without it. However, the use of
   CUBA is recommended as it provides integration routines tuned for
   performance, which are very usefull for integration in problems with
   large number of dimensions.

Note: Since version 1.5 the compilation of Cuba no longer crashes
      if you don't have Mathematica installed. To compile and install CUBA
      libraries use commands 'make lib ; make install'.

Installation Procedure
----------------------
Unpack the tarball containing the BAT source usually named like
BAT-x.x.tar.gz (here x.x is the version number) using command

    tar -xzf BAT-x.x.tar.gz

A directory called BAT-x.x will be created containing the source code.
Enter the directory and run the configuration using commands

    cd BAT-x.x
    ./configure

This will check your system for all components needed to compile BAT
and set up the paths for installation. You can add option
--prefix=/path/to/install/bat to ./configure to specify the the prefix
to the BAT installation path. The BAT library files will be installed
to $prefix/lib and the include files to $prefix/include. Default
installation prefix is /usr/local.

The configure script checks for ROOT availability in the system and
fails if ROOT is not installed. You can specify the ROOTSYS directory
using --with-rootsys=/path/to/rootsys.

You can compile BAT with the RooFit/RooStats support using
--with-roostats. The configure script will check whether the version of
ROOT is sufficient and whether the ROOT was compiled with RooFit/RooStats
support.

The configure will also search for libcuba.a and cuba.h in the system.
The libcuba.a has to be available in the standard system library search
path. You can specify the cuba.h location using
--with-cuba-path=/path/to/cuba/header.

You can list all available options using

    ./configure --help

After successful configuration run

    make
    make install

to compile and install BAT. Note that depending on the setting of
installation prefix you might need root priviledges to be able to install
BAT and run 'sudo make install' instead of plain 'make install'. If you
are installing BAT e.g. in your $HOMEDIR, you need to add the path to the
library and to the include files to the search path in your system.
Depending on your shell you can do that e.g. via commands

    export BATINSTALLDIR=/bat/install/prefix
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/lib
    export CPATH=$CPATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/include

or

    setenv BATINSTALLDIR     /bat/install/prefix
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH   $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/lib
    setenv CPATH             $CPATH:$BATINSTALLDIR/include

for bash and csh compatible shells, respectively. On Mac OS X you might
also need to setup DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

An option for use in compiled programs would also be to add
-I/bat/install/include/path to CXXFLAGS and -L/bat/install/lib/path to
LDFLAGS in your Makefile. However, the interactive ROOT macros will not
work if libBAT.so, libBATmodels, libBAT.rootmap and libBATmodels.rootmap
aren't in the system library search path.
