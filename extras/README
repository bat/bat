This directory contains subdirectories with different models and interfaces
provided with BAT.

Interfaces:
-----------

* StackModel
   - a model for fitting a "data histogram" to a set of "pdf histograms". 
   - see the tutorial on hypothesis testing for details 
   - Authors: Kevin Kroeninger <kevin.kroeninger@cern.ch>, Andrea Knue <andrea.knue@phys.uni-goettingen.de> 

* BinLikeTool
   - a model for fitting a single function to a set of histograms. The
     function depends on one "leading parameter"
   - this is useful, e.g., for the template method. One can fit several 
     templates with a smooth function and thus remove statistical functions, 
     see the examples BinLikeTool/TemplateFit. 
   - includes a summary of the goodness-of-fit for each histogram. 
   - includes an easy starter script.

More models and interfaces will be added in the future.
