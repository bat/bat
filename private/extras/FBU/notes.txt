Notes on FBU:
-------------

* Example with a simple shape and few bins
* Example with a simple shape and many bins
* Example with a complictated shape 


* with or without background

* do the number of bins of the reponse matrix and the truth
  distribution have to be the same?

* BCFBU::PrepareResponse should not need the background histogram
  -> is the binning of the background histogram and the reco axis of the migration matrix the same?

* how do you build the migration matrix? how do you treat events
  outside the acceptance region?
