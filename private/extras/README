This directory contains subdirectories with different models and interfaces
provided with BAT.

Models:
-----------

* BinLikeTool
   - a model for fitting a single function to a set of histograms. The
     function depends on one "leading parameter"
   - this is useful, e.g., for the template method. One can fit several 
     templates with a smooth function and thus remove statistical functions, 
     see the examples BinLikeTool/TemplateFit. 
   - includes a summary of the goodness-of-fit for each histogram. 
   - includes an easy starter script.
