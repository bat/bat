BAT ToDo (detail):
==================

1.  code cleanup
		- remove not needed methods/atributes
		- add checks on everything (make it easier to use for a normal user)
		- maybe start to think about using of (C++) exceptions?

1.  improve the installation procedure
    - autoconf/automake (cmake)?   
	  - MAC?
    - add Cuba to BAT by default?

2.  examples
    - add example for histogram fitting using poisson distributions
    - add example for non-flat prior

2.  implement the general p-value calculation using MCMC
    (since it's MCMC we could also have the possibility to sample
     according to posterior ?)

3.  Pretty-plotting of 2D+2x1D marginalized distributions together
    with output from MCMC

3.  ROOTified version

4.  more parallelizatoin

4.  some complex examples

99. GUI? (far far future)

x.	implement (already existing) methods for interpolation of multidimensional distributions, e.g. Kernel density estimators

x.	Calculate Bayes factors for model comparison

x.	CUBA library dependence
		- compare ROOT-version of VEGAS with CUBA
		- remove CUBA library dependence or ease installation

x.	Proposal functions:
		- provide arbitrary proposal functions
		- provide pre-defined proposal functions (Gaussian, box, etc.) 
		- provide proposal function based on Gaussian around global mode and inverse Hessian of log likelihood
