BinLikeTool: 
------------

Purpose: 
--------
Fit a single function to a set of histograms. Each histogram is
associated with a "leading parameter". The fit function also depends
on this parameter. The fitting is done by assuming bin-independent
Poisson-fluctuations. This tool can be used, e.g., for fitting several
templates to a smooth function.

How to get started: 
-------------------
1. Run the script setup.sh. This will include the current directory
into the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

2. Run the script CreateFitModel.sh. This will create a directory
including a class (.h, .cxx) and a Makefile. The class inherits from
the BinLikeModel.

3. Modify the .cxx class of the model: 
   a) DefineParameters : add the model parameters. 
   b) Expectation : return the expectation value for a bin. 

4. Modify the run file: 
   a) Read in all necessary histograms.
   b) Add all histograms with a leading parameter value to the model. 

5. Compile and run. 

Example:
--------
An example can be found in the directory TemplateFit. Create a set of
histograms with the script CreateHistograms.cxx (this needs to be
compiled in ROOT, i.e., called like this: root -l
CreateHistograms.cxx++) and then compile and run the model.
