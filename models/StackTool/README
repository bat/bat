==========

Description: 
------------
The StackTool is used to fit a set of templates to a histogram. The
statistical method used is described in the document provided with
this tool.

Version:

v1.0 

Features:
---------
* The sum of a set of expectation values can be constrained to some
  value x. x is assumed to be known with some (Gaussian) uncertainty.
* Gaussian priors for the expectation values can be set.
* Gaussian priors for the efficiencies can be set.
* Ratios of any expectation values can be calculated.
* Error propagation without approximations is possible by calculating
  any function of the expectation values.
* Unphysical limits, i.e., expectation values smaller than 0 can be
  used or not.
* The sum of all expectation values can be constrained to the number
  of events in the data histogram.
* A tool for performing ensemble tests is provided.

Examples:
---------
* A simplified template fit for extracting the W-helicity in top
  decays. (directory ./Whel)
* An example on fitting several models and comparing them. (directory
 ./hypothesis)
