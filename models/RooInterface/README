README file for the BCRooInterface class
----------------------------------------

The following lines describe how to get the BCRooInterface to compile
and how to run the example. ROOT 5.22 is required for this to work
properly.

Compilation of BAT: it is assumed you installed BAT according to:
http://www.mppmu.mpg.de/bat/?page=install&version=0.2.1

Compilation of BCRooInterface.o and runRooInterface.exe

    cd models/RooInterface
    make

Running the example: you need first to prepare the roodata.root file
that contains the PDF and prior probability models.

The two examples provided are:

 - Number counting experiment in the presence of signal and
   background. The likelihood being the Poisson formula and the signal
   prior flat. The data is transformed into a weighted dataset to make
   the fit faster.

    root -q -x -l PrepareWorkspace_Poisson.C

 - Unbinned likelihood model: The signal is assumed to have a gaussian
   PDF and the background a flat shape. The signal prior is flat.

    root -q -x -l PrepareWorkspace_GaussOverFlat.C

Then one can use the compiled interface macro:

    ./runRooInterface.exe

Notes:
 - this is a preliminary version of the interface that will be
   improved

More documentation, examples and maybe an undated version of this
interface might be available on the webpage:
