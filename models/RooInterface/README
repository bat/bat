The following lines describe how I got BAT and the BCRooInterface to
compile and how to run the example. ROOT 5.22 is required for this to
work properly.

Compilation of BAT:

    source ~/work/setroot.csh
    ./configure
    make
    setenv BATINSTALLDIR ${PWD}
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${BATINSTALLDIR}/src/.libs

Compilation of BCRooInterface.o and runRooInterface.exe

    cd BCRooInterface
    ln -s ../BAT
    ln -s ../.libs/libBAT.a
    ln -s ../.libs/libBAT.so
    make

Running the example: you need first to prepare the roodata.root file that
contains the PDF and prior probability models.

The two examples provided are:

 - Number counting experiment in the presence of signal and background.
   The likelihood being the Poisson formula and the signal prior flat.
   The data is transformed into a weighted dataset to make the fit faster.

    root -q -x -l PrepareWorkspace_Poisson.C

 - Unbinned likelihood model: The signal is assumed to have a gaussian PDF
   and the background a flat shape. The signal prior is flat.

    root -q -x -l PrepareWorkspace_GaussOverFlat.C

Then one can use the compiled interface macro:

    ./runRooInterface.exe

Notes and to-do list:
 - this is a preliminary version of the interface that will be improved
 - need to provide an arbitrary .root input file as argument to
   runRooInterface.exe
 - perform additional X-checks
 - RooWorkspace not able to store RooArgList. A work-around has been used.
   In the next ROOT development/production release this feature will be
   added and the workaround then corrected.
 - fModel, ... names are hard coded
