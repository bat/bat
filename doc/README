BAT - Bayesian Analysis Toolkit
version __CVS_VERSION__
-------------------------------

Bayesian Analysis Toolkit is a software analysis package which allows
to address the main goals of a typical data anaysis:

 - compare model predictions with data,
 - draw conclusions on the validity of the model as a representation
   of the data and
 - extract the possible values of parameters within the context of
   a model.

BAT is based on Bayes' Theorem and is realized with the use of Markov
Chain Monte Carlo. This gives access to the full posterior probability
distribution and enables straightforward parameter estimation, limit
setting and uncertainty propagation.

BAT is implemented in C++ with emphasis put to flexibility and
modularity in defining models while keeping in mind the reliability
and speed requirements of the numerical operations.

The information about the main features introduced in this version
can be found in doc/releasnotes.txt. The detailed list of changes
can be found in doc/changelog.
