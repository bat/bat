Cuba interface
--------------
o Improved configuration with Cuba support. Compilation with Cuba has to
  be explicitly requested when running configure script.
o Changes to allow running with Cuba 2.0 or later.


Priors
------
o Fixed fast fitters to allow setting of priors vie SetPrior*() methods.
o Added possibility to set prior via a histogram.


EfficiencyFitter
----------------
o Plot with the fit now shows data points represented as mode + smallest 68%
  interval by default. It is also possible to plot mean + rms and median  +
  central 68% interval.
o Fixed numerical instability when plotting the fit.


TemplateFitter
--------------
o Added possibility to use histograms with non-equal bin sizes as templates.
o Added calculation of Chi2 with global and marginalized mode and calculation
  of pull.
o It is now possible to generate pseudo-data using any arbitrary set of
  parameters, e.g. prior or posterior.
o Added some drawing options.
o Fixed initialization of fitting and ensemble testing.
o Updated examples.


Math
----
o Caching factorial values up to 1000. Settable by the user.


SummaryTool
-----------
o PrintCorrelationPlot() method now draws a 'triangle plot' with all available
  1D and 2D marginalized distributions.
o Renamed PrintKnowlegdeUpdatePlot() to PrintKnowledgeUpdatePlots().
