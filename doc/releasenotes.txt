BAT - Bayesian Analysis Toolkit
------------------------------------------
Release notes for version:    0.4
Release date:                 2010-XX-XX
Urgency:                      medium
------------------------------------------

This version contains many improvements and updates and several bugfixes. The
most important changes are summarized below. For detailed list of changes see
the Changelog. For more information consult the BAT webpage at
http://www.mppmu.mpg.de/bat/


Installation procedure
----------------------
o Fixed compilation with Cuba support on Mac OS X.
o Pre-defined models were separated into a separate shared library libBATmodels.so
  which needs to be included when linking a program that uses them. No change is
  needed if they are used in the Root interactive session.
o Makefiles for all examples are now automatically setup during configuration
  step to use/not use Cuba or RooFit/RooStats. Also they include a reference to
  environmental variable $BATINSTALLDIR such that if this variable is set properly
  it is no longer necessary to adjust the makefiles with the installation of the
  new BAT version.
  Same adjustments were done to CreateProject.sh script which is now also setup
  during configuration.

Model setup
-----------
o Added a possibility to set priors for parameters as TF1 objects.
o Flat priors are being cached to speed up the MCMC.
o Added a possibility to re-set parameter ranges.

MCMC
----
o Fixed MCMC convergence check.
o Added pre-defined levels of MCMC precision (Low, Medium, High, VeryHigh).
o For sequential MCMC setup only fill marginalized distributions once per sequence.
o Added virtual method MCMCCurrentPointInterface() which gives user access to each
  generated point in the MCMC regardless of whether it has been assepted or not.
o Virtual method MCMCTrialFunctionSingle() now returns double, i.e., the proposal
  point in a single dimension.
o Allowed storing of pre-run in the Root file.
o Renamed branch names in the tree containing the MCMC:
  - removed prefix 'f' from the names
  - renamed LogLokelihood to LogProbability as that is what's being recorded

Additions
---------
o Added a fast-fitter class BCTemplateFitter which allows an easy way of template
  fitting.
o Added BCSummaryTool providing plots and tables summarizing the output of the MCMC.
o Examples were reorganized to three cathegories: basic, advanced, expert; and many
  new examples were added.

Interface to RooFit/RooStats
----------------------------
o Support for RooFit workspaces and an interface allowing to run BAT from within
  RooStats can now be optionally compiled with BAT. They require Root version
  5.27/04 or later.

Plots
-----
o Legend is now printed on all marginalized distributions by default.
o Fixed bug in plotting of upper limits.
