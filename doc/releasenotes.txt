Bugfixes:
# fixed reading data from textfile which caused that in case there was
  a newline character at the end of file, the last datapoint was included
  twice

  BCModelOutput
# fixed bug in MCMC which caused incorrect sampling near boundary of the
  parameter space in case the bulk of the distribution was too close
  to the boundary
