This is the INSTALL file of BAT package
---------------------------------------
You can find here a short description of what to do to be able to
compile and use BAT on your computer. This is a very first version
of this file. In the future a detailed description should become
a part of the manual.


Platforms
----------
BAT has been developed on Linux machines running different distributions
and different versions of the kernel and gcc. As far as we know there
is nothing distribution dependent inside of BAT. However, we have not yet
started to systematically check for compatibility and portability. This is
planned for future releases of BAT. For the moment the only statement
we can do here is that if you don't have a too old or too specific
installation of Linux you should be able to compile and use BAT without
problems.

Windows is not supported for the moment.

Dependencies
-------------
ROOT:
   ROOT is an object oriented data analysis framework. You can obtain
   it from http://root.cern.ch/. To compile and run BAT you will need
   a ROOT version 5.16 or later. Please, check your linux distribution
   for the availability of precompiled packages on your system. Mostly
   used distributions nowdays have the ROOT packages available.
CUBA:
   CUBA is a library containing general purpose multidimensional
   integration algorithms. It can be obtained from
   http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/. In future versions of BAT we plan to
   make the use of CUBA optional but for the moment it has to be installed
   on your system if you want to compile BAT.


Installation Procedure
----------------------
Manual installation is necessary at the moment which contains just a few
staps.

Unpack the tarball containing the BAT source usually named like
bat-x.x.tgz (here x.x is the version number) using command

    tar -xzf bat-x.x.tgz

A directory called bat-x.x will be created containing the source code.
Enter the directory and run the compilation using commands

    cd bat-x.x
    make

After a successful compilation a file called libBAT.so will be created
which is a shared library.

To complete the installation you have to put the library as well as the
include files into the location accessible to the compiler on your system.
The simplest way is to add the options -L/bat/library/location/path/ and
-I/bat/include/location/path/ to the gcc compiler commands during
compilation (or to your makefile). More permanent solution is to
make the the location of library/includes available to the system via setting

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/bat/lib/location/path/
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/bat/inc/location/path/

or

    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH     $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/bat/lib/location/path/
    setenv CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH  $CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/bat/inc/location/path/

for bash and csh compatible shells, respectively.

In the future we plan to automatize the whole installation process, possibly
using autoconf/automake tools.
