Nightlies       short           Allows to create patches for smaller bug 
                                fixes and updates, inparticular for tools and models.

Constraints     medium          Implement constraints among the parameters.

ROOT analysis   medium          Perform analysis of MCMC tree from ROOT file. This could include
                                a set of macros and a GUI. Nice student project. 
KDE             medium          Use Kernel Density Estimator for filling histograms as option.
                                This goes together with the ROOT tree analysis.


ECDF			medium			For 1 dim. marginalized distributions and all samples available,
								it is more accurate to use the empirical cumulative to calculate
								limits, the median etc. Even the 1D mode using the empirical PDF is 
								easily accessible.

Hybrid chains   long            Harrison Prosper brought up the topic. Looks like an 
                                interesting extension to the Metropolis algorithm.

Sub-space int.  long            Can we implement sub-space integration into the current version?

Nested sampling long            Alan Tua showed interest in implementing it. New version?
								Interface to MultiNest?

Parallel		nBAT			allow BAT to run in parallel, for example using one processor/chain
								and communication with MPI. Or OpenMP for simple multicore.

Resume			nBAT			Need ability to checkpoint and resume to run bigger jobs on clusters.
								
Rerun			nBAT			Rerun marginalization on existing posterior samples. This way the samples
								could come from an arbitrary sampling algorithm. e.g. MultiNest
