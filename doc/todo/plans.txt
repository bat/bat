Nightlies       short           Allows to create patches for smaller bug 
                                fixes and updates, inparticular for tools and models.

Constraints     medium          Implement constraints among the parameters.

ROOT analysis   medium          Perform analysis of MCMC tree from ROOT file. This could include
                                a set of macros and a GUI. Nice studen project. 
KDE             medium          Use Kernel Density Estimator for filling histograms as option.
                                This goes together with the ROOT tree analysis.

Hybrid chains   long            Harrison Prosper brought up the topic. Looks like an 
                                interesting extension to the Metropolis algorithm.

Sub-space int.  long            Can we implement sub-space integration into the current version?

Nested sampling long            Alan Tua showed interest in implementing it. New version?
								Interface to MultiNest?
