BAT detailed ToDo list
Updated on 9/10/2008
======================

1.
=============
- bugfixes
     - ...

- b  code cleanup
     - further removal not needed methods/atributes
     - add checks on everything (make it easier to use for a normal user)
     - maybe start to think about using of (C++) exceptions?

- c  implement the general p-value calculation using MCMC - DONE
     - since it's MCMC we could also have the possibility to sample
       according to posterior ?

- d  re-do everything with likelihood instead of conditional probability
     entry
     - done, we just need to remove the methods for the conditional
       probability entry

2.
=============
- a  examples
     - examples with non flat prior
     - more complex examples

- b  manual

- c  improve the installation procedure
     - use Vegas from ROOT and drop dependence on Cuba?


3.
=============
- a  Pretty-plotting of 2D+2x1D marginalized distributions together
     with output from MCMC


4.
=============
- a  more parallelizatoin

- b  some complex examples

- c  implement (already existing) methods for interpolation of
     multidimensional distributions, e.g. Kernel density estimators

- d  Proposal functions:
     - provide arbitrary proposal functions
     - provide pre-defined proposal functions (Gaussian, box, etc.)
     - provide proposal function based on Gaussian around global mode and
       inverse Hessian of log likelihood



Far future
=============
- a  GUI
