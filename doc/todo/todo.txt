ToDo list:
----------

For later releases:
===================
Priority:    Status:   Task:                     
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
medium                 Fix memory leaks in BCH1D and other classes
medium                 Allocate BestFitParameters, Errors, Marginalized... upon parameter addition
medium                 Move getters and setters to the class where the attributes are defined (not the case for BestFitParameters, Errors, Marginalized, etc.)
medium                 method to fix parameters
medium                 Simplify retrieving parameter uncertainty, add histogram pointer to BCParameter and add short cuts
medium                 Speed up FastFitters by cutting data range to TF1 range
medium                 Implement better selection of marginalized distributions to fill, switch on/off 1-d and 2-d histogram
medium                 Perform analysis of MCMC tree from ROOT file
medium        	       get 1D limits from ECDF and tree
medium                 ROOT: enable compiling programs with 'root BATcode.C++'
medium                 Jeffrey's +reference prior from RooStats
medium                 Adaptive multidimensional proposal function (see e.g. Examples of Adaptive MCMC, Roberts, G. and Rosenthal, J.; 2008)
medium                 option to tag parameter as nuisance and ignore nuisance in marginal distributions


low                    Look into sparse histograms
low                    Library of common priors
low                    Use Kernel Density Estimator for filling histograms as option
low                    Constraints
low                    p-value from arbitrary test statistic for data generated with MCMC. Possible already for BCHistogramFitter


Release independent:
====================
Priority:    Status:   Task:                     
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
high                   Check/change tutorials

medium                 Update introduction on R-value criterion (Fred)
medium                 Add models page on web page

For release 1.0:
================

Update user's guide (Kevin, everyone)
 - Consistent (de-)allocation of resources. Make user aware that his data passed by pointers to BAT is typically not deleted by BAT.
Add web page for "How to get started" (Fred)
Add web page for models and tools (Kevin/Dano?)
Add web page for "screen shots" (Kevin/Dano?)
Add web page for published results and examples (Kevin/Dano?)
Add bug tracker (Fred)
Update FAQ (everyone)
Add BANFF challenge tutorial to web page (Shabnaz)
Update tutorials (Shabanz)
Change of interface: reference instead of copy vector (Kevin)
clean up: remove everything that is not used (everyone)
Check if integration correct in >3 dimensions: test suite (Jens?)
Allow user to set scales for MCMC (Kevin will check)
Allow user to define multivariate proposal function (Kevin)
Remove MCMC code from BCIntegrate (Dano?)
Remove ConditionalProbabilityEntry stuff (Dano?)
Export tested R-value calculation routine to BCMath (Fred)
More warning options and compiler options (Fred)
Public/virtual methods (Shabnaz)
Is the p-value calculator reliable (Shabnaz)

optional:
use ROOT integration methods instead of slow MC for d <= 3 (Jens?)
allow to select Cuba algorithm (Divonne, Cuhre) (Jens?) 
allow to tune Cuba integration parameters (Divonne, Cuhre) (Jens?) 
Sub-space integration, post-processing? (Arnulf?)
