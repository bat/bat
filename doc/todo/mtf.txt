Wish list for MTF:
==================

* update plotting:

  - general update, e.g., pdf output

  - plotting option a la Mai. done.

* implement fast p-value evaluation

* analyse a data set with Poisson-fluctuated templates, i.e. bin-wise
  fluctuations:

  - need the MC-stat. uncertainty in each bin, can we take them from
    the histograms? yes. done.

  - need a method to return a fluctuated template. Options:
    Poisson/Gauss. done.

  - ensemble test: fix input data set and analyse it with a set of
    fluctuated templates. done.

* easy way to generate ensembles according to the priors of nuisance
  parameters.
