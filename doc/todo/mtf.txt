ToDo list for MTF:
==================

ToDo:

- easy way to generate ensembles according to the priors of nuisance
  parameters.

- do not use gRandom in generation of ensembles, but something with
  controlled random seed. 

- do the templates have to be pointers?

- why does the ensemble test have a "start" value? Why not random ensembles?

- move stack plotting to channel?

- fix plotting of templates in channel (add title)

- plotting of all stacks into a single pdf file

- plotting of stack plot with juxtaposed channels

- add legend including channel title

- add difference/ratio/significance plot below

- check for b0/1 if the mcmc was run

- update examples: include reasonable plotting options.

- allow changing the color scheme for for stack plots

- single chanel analysis: add automatic running for the following:
  remove one systematic uncertainty at a time to check its severeness.

- single chanel analysis: add automatic running for the following:
  remove one channel at a time to check its impact.

- check what happens with delta-priors. Histogram pointer is 0?

- what happens if no template is set?

Done:

* update plotting:

  - general update, e.g., pdf output. done

  - plotting option a la Mai. done.

- fix plotting of stack. done.

* implement fast p-value evaluation. done.

* analyse a data set with Poisson-fluctuated templates, i.e. bin-wise
  fluctuations:

  - need the MC-stat. uncertainty in each bin, can we take them from
    the histograms? yes. done.

  - need a method to return a fluctuated template. Options:
    Poisson/Gauss. done.

  - ensemble test: fix input data set and analyse it with a set of
    fluctuated templates. done.
