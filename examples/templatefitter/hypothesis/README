Example on template fitting "hypothesis":

The motivation for this analysis is to fit different models to a
histogram and compare the models. The source code is commented and
exaplains the individual steps. Three files are part of this example:

Makefile               - the Makefile

runHypothesisTest.cxx  - this macro performs a template fit to a single data
                         set for different models

histograms.root        - the file containing all templates and the data
                         histogram
