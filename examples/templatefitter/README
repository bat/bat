TemplateFitter: 
=============

Description: 
------------
The TemplateFitter is used to fit a set of templates to a
histogram.

* Daniel Kollar, CERN 
* Kevin Kroeninger, University of Goettingen 

Features:
---------
* The sum of a set of expectation values can be constrained to some
  value x. x is assumed to be known with some (Gaussian) uncertainty.

* Gaussian priors for the expectation values can be set.

* Gaussian priors for the efficiencies can be set.

* Ratios of any expectation values can be calculated.

* Error propagation without approximations is possible by calculating
  any function of the expectation values.

* Unphysical limits, i.e., expectation values smaller than 0 can be
  used or not.

* The sum of all expectation values can be constrained to the number
  of events in the data histogram.

* Systematic uncertainties can be included as a function of the
  variable under study.

* A tool for performing ensemble tests is provided.

Examples:
---------
A set of examples is provided with the tool. See the README file in
the sub-directory on how to run them. The examples are: 

* A simplified template fit for extracting the W-helicity in top
  decays. 
  Directory: ./Whel

* An example on fitting several models and comparing them.
  Directory: ./hypothesis

* An example for fitting a Gaussian signal on top of a flat background
  for low statistics. The physics case is the search for neutrinoless
  double beta-decay.
