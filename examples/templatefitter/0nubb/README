Example on template fitting "Neutrinoless double beta-decay":
=============================================================

Motivation:
-----------
The physics motivation for this analysis is the search for
neutrinoless double beta-decay. Two template (Gaussian signal and flat
background) are fitted to histogram with a very small number of
entries. The source code is commented and exaplains the individual
steps. Four files are part of this example.

Files:
------
CreateHistogram.c   - this needs to be run first to generate the
                      templates and a data set

Makefile            - the Makefile

runTemplateFit.cxx  - this macro performs a template fit to a single data
                      set

runEnsembleTest.cxx - this macro performs an ensemble test for a given
                      combination of templates.

How to run:
-----------
1) Create the necessary histograms for the example by running the
   macro:

   root CreateHistograms.c

2) Create the executables: 

   make 

3) To perform an analysis on a single data set run the executable:

   ./runTemplateFit

4) To perform ensemble tests run the executable:

   ./runEnsembleTest
