Description: 
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to properly define a new model class based on
the BCModel class or on any previously defined class which inherits
from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create a simple compiled program
using BAT. 

It shows how to implement error propagation in BAT. Two values, x and
y, are measured with a certain (Gaussian) precision. The quantity of
interest is the ratio of the two, r=x/y, i.e., the probability density
for r, p(r|x,y).

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:

Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

   For the compilation to work properly, the script bat-config needs
   to be accessible, for example by adding its directory to the PATH
   environment variable.

3. Run the executable 'runErrorPropagation'.
