Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to properly define a new model class based on
the BCModel class or on any previously defined class which inherits
from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create a simple compiled program
using BAT.

It shows how to write the MCMC into a ROOT file. The actual model is a
simple 2D Gaussian.

In addition the ROOT macro shows a simple example of analyzing the
stored MCMC and producing the marginalized distributions "offline".

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:

Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

   For the compilation to work properly BAT needs to be installed
   in the standard system accessible location or in the path defined
   by the BATINSTALLDIR environmental variable.

3. Run the executable 'runRootOutput'.

4. Run macro analyzeMCMCTree.C in ROOT, e.g., using 'root analyzeMCMCTree.C'
