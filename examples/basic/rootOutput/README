Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to properly define a new model class based on
the BCModel class or on any previously defined class which inherits
from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create a simple compiled program
using BAT.

It shows how to write the MCMC into a ROOT file. The actual model is a
simple 2D Gaussian.

A second program shows how to read the stored MCMC in and produce the
marginalized distributions "offline." And a third program shows how to
read in the stored MCMC and continue running the Markov chains.

The source files contain plenty of comments and explanations.

Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

   For the compilation to work properly, the script bat-config needs
   to be accessible, for example by adding its directory to the PATH
   environment variable.

3. Run the executable 'runRootOutput'.

4. Run the executable 'readRootOutput'.

5. Run the executable 'continueMCMC'.
