Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to properly define a new model class based on
the BCModel class or on any previously defined class which inherits
from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create a simple compiled program
using BAT.

It shows how to implement a simple Poisson model in BAT. The free
parameter of the model is the expected number of "events", while the
number of observed "events" is given. No prior knowledge of the
parameter is assumed.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations.

Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

  For the compilation to work properly, the script bat-config needs
  to be accessible, for example by adding its directory to the PATH
  environment variable.

3. Run the executable 'runPoissonCounting'.
