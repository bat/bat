Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to properly define a new model class based on
the BCModel class or on any previously defined class which inherits
from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create a simple compiled program
using BAT.

This example shows how to combine two measurements in BAT. A quantity
("mass") has been measured and the result is combined with the results
from an earlier experiment. The latter is implemented as the prior
knowledge while the former is the Likelihood.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations.

Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

   For the compilation to work properly, the script bat-config needs
   to be accessible, for example by adding its directory to the PATH
   environment variable.

3. Run the executable 'runCombineGaussians'.
