Description: 
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to properly define a new model class based on
the BCModel class or on any previously defined class which inherits
from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create a simple compiled program
using BAT. 

This example shows how to combine two measurements in BAT. Two
correlated quantities ("mass" and "cross section") have been measured
and the result is combined with the results from two earlier and
independent experiments. The latter is implemented as the prior
knowledge while the former is the Likelihood.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:

Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

	For the compilation to work properly BAT needs to be installed
	in the standard system accessible location or in the path defined
	by the BATINSTALLDIR environmental variable.

3. Run the executable 'runCombineGaussians'.
