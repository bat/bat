Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to use the histogram fitter which comes with
BAT. It fits a const + Gaussian function to a histogram assuming
Poissonian uncertainties in each bin.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:
