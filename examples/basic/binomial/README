Description: 
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to properly define a new model class based on
the BCModel class or on any previously defined class which inherits
from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create a simple compiled program
using BAT. 

It shows how to implement a simple binomial model in BAT. The free
parameter of the model is the efficiency, while the total number of
"events" is given as well as a number of selected "events".  No prior
knowledge of the parameter is assumed.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:

Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

   For the compilation to work properly BAT needs to be installed
   in the standard system accessible location or in the path defined
   by the BATINSTALLDIR environmental variable.

3. Run the executable 'runEfficiency'.
