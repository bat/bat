This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed in the system.

The eample shows how to preperly define a new model class
based on the BCModel class or on any previously defined class
which inherits from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create
a simple compiled program using BAT.

In the example there are many of BAT features shown. The source
files contain plenty of comments and explanations.


The files:
----------

   Makefile       - makefile for the example program
   Pol1Asymm.h    - definition of a model class for straight line
                    fit with asymmetric errors
   Pol1Asymm.cxx  - soure code of the Pol1Asymm class
   Pol2Asymm.h    - definition of a model class for quadratic
                    fit with asymmetric errors
   Pol2Asymm.cxx  - soure code of the Pol2Asymm class
   asymmErrorsFitterExample.cxx
                  - source code of the main program
   CreateData.C   - a ROOT macro for creating the data to fit


Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory
   o  If your version of BAT was not compiled with cuba and
      you don't have Cuba installed in your system you might
      need to remove '-lcuba' from the two following lines
      in the Makefile before running 'make'. Otherwise the
      example won't compile.

      LIBS        += $(ROOTLIBS)  -lBAT -lcuba
      GLIBS       += $(ROOTGLIBS) -lBAT -lcuba

3. Prepare the dataset to fit using the ROOT macro CreateData.C
   (e.g. by running root CreateData.C from the command line)

4. Run the executable 'asymmErrorsFitterExample'
