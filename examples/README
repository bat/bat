All examples require that BAT was successfully installed in the system.
Instructions on how to run the examples are either inside the source
code (for ROOT macros) or in the README file (for compiled examples)

You can also find tutorials on BAT webpage: www.mppmu.mpg.de/bat

Examples in this directory:
-------------------------------

example01:
   Straight line fit using GraphFitter assuming gaussian uncertainties.
   It demonstrates the most simplest usage of BAT.
   (ROOT macro)

example02:
   Histogram fit using poissonian uncertainties.
   (ROOT macro)

example03:
   Graph fits using 4 different functions assuming gaussian uncertainties.
   This example represents the example from the BAT paper showing
   a comparison between different fits. It also sdemonstrates the usage of
	 the SummaryTool.
   (ROOT macro)

example04:
   Efficiency fit. Shows how to fit a histogram ratio where the numerator
   histogram is a subset of the denominator histogram. Binomial
   uncertainties are used.
   (ROOT macro)

example05:
   Example showing how to define own complicated models and build
   a program for running with BAT. It shows fits using two functions
   when assuming asymmetric uncertainties.
   (Compiled program)

roointerface:
   Examples of usage of the RooInterface showing how BAT analysis can be
	 performed on a RooFit workspace.

template:
   Examples for how to fit several templates to a data set using
   1-dim. histograms. The examples feature the BCTemplateFitter which
   is included in the models directory. 
   (ROOT macros and compiled programs)
