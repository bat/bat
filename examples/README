Examples in this directory:
---------------------------

* Example01: Line fit. 
	A simple line fit to a set of data points.

* Example02: Polynomial fitting. 
	Fit of three different polynomials to a set of data points.
	Comparison of the three models using the p-value. 

* Example03: Spectrum fit. 
	Comparison of two different models assuming either a flat background
	spectrum or a background + signal spectrum. The model comparison is
	performed using the direct comparison of model probabilities.

* Example04: Binomial errors. 
	A simple example for the binomial distribution.

Note:
-----

For some of the examples, it might be necessary to run the ROOT macro
"CreateData.c" prior to the analysis. The macro will create a data set
suitable for the analysis.
