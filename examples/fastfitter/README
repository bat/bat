All examples require that BAT was successfully installed in the system.
Instructions on how to run the examples are either inside the source
code (for ROOT macros) or in the README file (for compiled examples)

Fast fitter examples in this directory:
---------------------------------------

graphFitter:
   Straight line fit using GraphFitter assuming gaussian uncertainties.
   It demonstrates the most simplest usage of BAT.
   (ROOT macro)

histogramFitter:
   Histogram fit using poissonian uncertainties.
   (ROOT macro)

efficiencyFitter:
   Efficiency fit. Shows how to fit a histogram ratio where the numerator
   histogram is a subset of the denominator histogram. Binomial
   uncertainties are used.
   (ROOT macro)

advancedGraphFitter:
   Graph fits using 4 different functions assuming gaussian uncertainties.
   This example represents the example from the BAT paper showing
   a comparison between different fits. It also sdemonstrates the usage of
	 the SummaryTool.
   (ROOT macro)
