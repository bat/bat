Example on template fitting "0nubb":

The physics motivation for this analysis is the search for
neutrinoless double beta-decay. The source code is commented and
exaplains the individual steps. Four files are part of this example:

CreateHistogram.c   - this needs to be run first to generate the
										  templates and a data set

Makefile            - the Makefile

runTemplateFit.cxx  - this macro performs a template fit to a single data
                      set

runEnsembleTest.cxx - this macro performs an ensemble test for a given
								 	    combination of templates.
