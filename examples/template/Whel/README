Example on template fitting "W helicity":

The physics motivation for this analysis is the extraction of the
fraction of right-handed W-bosons in top decays. The source code is
commented and exaplains the individual steps. Three files are part of
this example: 

CreateHistogram.c - this needs to be run first to generate the
										templates and a data set

templatefit.cxx   - this macro performs a template fit to a single data
                    set

ensembletest.cxx  - this macro performs an ensemble test for a given
								 	  combination of templates.
