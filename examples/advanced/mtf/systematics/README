Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

This example is similar to the `twoChannels' example, but now
including two sources of systematic uncertainty which alter the
templates.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations.
For further information, see the manual at

Files:
------

  README             - this file
  Makefile           - makefile for the example program
  runSystematics.cxx - the source code of the main program
  CreateHistograms.C - a macro which create the templates and the pseudodata histograms



Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Create the templates and data histograms by calling the ROOT
   macro 'root CreateHistogram.C'

3. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

   For the compilation to work properly, the script bat-config needs
   to be accessible, for example by adding its directory to the PATH
   environment variable.

4. Run the executable 'runSystematics'.
