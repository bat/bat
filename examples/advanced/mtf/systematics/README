Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

This example is similar to the `twoChannels' example, but now
including two sources of systematic uncertainty which alter the
templates.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:

Files:
------

  README             - this file
  Makefile           - makefile for the example program
  runSystematics.cxx - the source code of the main program
  CreateHistograms.C - a macro which create the templates and the pseudodata histograms



Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Create the templates and data histograms by calling the ROOT
   macro 'root CreateHistogram.C' 

3. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

	For the compilation to work properly BAT needs to be installed
	in the standard system accessible location or in the path defined
	by the BATINSTALLDIR environmental variable.

4. Run the executable 'runSystematics'.
