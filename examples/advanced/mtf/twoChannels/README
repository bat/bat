Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to perform a fit with two channels. The signal
is a Gaussian in both channels, but wider in the second one. Also, the
efficiency in both channels is different. Each channel has one
channel-specific background.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:

  CreateHistograms.C - a macro which create the templates and the pseudodata histograms



Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Create the templates and data histograms by calling the ROOT
   macro 'root CreateHistogram.C' 

3. Run the macro in a ROOT session, e.g., with 'root twoChannels.C'
