example1.C:
A simple fit of a Gaussian peak on top of a flat background

example2.C:

A fit with two channels. The signal is a Gaussian in both channels,
but wider in the second one. Also, the efficiency in both channels is
different. Each channel has one channel-specific background. 

example3.C:

Same setting as in example2.C, but now ensemble tests are
performed. The ensembles are generated assuming the same statistical
model using the best-fit parameters.
