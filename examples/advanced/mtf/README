singleChannel:
--------------
A simple fit of a Gaussian peak on top of a flat background

twoChannels:
------------
A fit with two channels. The signal is a Gaussian in both channels,
but wider in the second one. Also, the efficiency in both channels is
different. Each channel has one channel-specific background.

ensembletest:
-------------
Same setting as in twoChannels example, but now ensemble tests are
performed. The ensembles are generated assuming the same statistical
model using the best-fit parameters.

systematics:
------------
A similar example, but now including two sources of systematic
uncertainty which alter the templates.

mcstat:
-------
The example shows how to estimate the impact of finite MC statistics
of the templates in a simple fit of a Gaussian peak on top of a flat
background.
