Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows the same example a the `twoChannels' example, but
now ensemble tests are performed. The ensembles are generated assuming
the same statistical model using the best-fit parameters.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:

  README             - this file
  ensembleTest.C     - the source code of the main program
  CreateHistograms.C - a macro which create the templates and the pseudodata histograms



Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Create the templates and data histograms by calling the ROOT
   macro 'root CreateHistogram.C' 

3. Run the macro in a ROOT session, e.g., with 'root ensembleTest.C'
