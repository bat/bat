Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to estimate the impact of finite MC statistics
of the templates in a simple fit of a Gaussian peak on top of a flat
background.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:

  mcstat.C           - the source code of the main program
  CreateHistograms.C - a macro which create the templates and the pseudodata histograms



Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Create the templates and data histograms by calling the ROOT
   macro 'root CreateHistogram.C' 

3. Run the macro in a ROOT session, e.g., with 'root mcstat.C'
