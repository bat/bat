!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! IMPORTANT !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! To be able to run the examples described here, BAT has to be compiled
!!! with the Roofit/RooStats support.
!!!
!!! The examples are not thread safe. If BAT is compiled with support for
!!! threading, one has to set the number of threads to 1; e.g.,
!!! OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 ./runRooInterface ...
!!!
!!! See BAT installation instructions for details.

BCRooInterface
--------------

The BCRooInterface is a model interface developed in order to allow
running BAT (Bayesian Analysis Toolkit) from a data/pdf/prior model
described using RooFit package that is available from ROOT.

BATCalculator
-------------

BATCalulator builds upon the BCRooInterface class and provides an interface
that can be used just like any other Interval Calulator in RooStats.

INSTALLATION
------------

As of BAT version 0.4 BCRooInterface as well as BATCalculator can be
optionally compiled during BAT compilation. See BAT installation
instructions for details.


RUNNING THE BCRooInterface EXAMPLES
-----------------------------------

Compile the program by running

   make

This will create an executable called runRooInterface.

To run the interface, you need first to prepare a ROOT file that
contains the PDF and prior probability models.

The four examples are provided:

 - Number counting experiment in the presence of signal and
   background. The likelihood being the Poisson formula and the signal
   prior flat.

    root -q -x -l PrepareWorkspace_Poisson.C

 - The same but taking the background yield as a nuisance parameter
   with a Gaussian prior.

    root -q -x -l PrepareWorkspace_Poisson_withSystematics.C

 - Unbinned likelihood model: The signal is assumed to have a gaussian
   PDF and the background a flat shape. The signal prior is flat.

    root -q -x -l PrepareWorkspace_GaussOverFlat.C

 - The same but taking the background yield and the sigma of the
   signal PDF as nuisance parameters with Gaussian priors.

    root -q -x -l PrepareWorkspace_GaussOverFlat_withSystematics.C

Then one can use the compiled interface macro. Calling runRooInterface without
arguments will display some help information and proceed running with default
file names. The user can specify 2 arguments being the name of the ROOT file
that contains the RooWorkspace (holding the RooFit objects representing the
data/pdf/prior/etc), and optionally the name of this workspace (default:
myWS). In any case, the ROOT file should contain a workspace that itself
contains:

 - data: a RooAbsData object holding the data measurements
 - model: a RooAbsPdf object holding the probability density function
 - priorPOI and priorNuisance: two RooAbsPdf objects representing
   respectively the prior probability on the parameter of interest and
   the nuisance parameters. The final prior PDF will be a product of
   those two distributions. This separation is done in order to be
   able to re-use these object differently in other statistical
   methods. In case priorPOI or priorNuisance is a null pointer only
   the other one will be used (this way correlation between the POI
   and other nuisance parameters can be accomodated)
 - POI: a RooArgList holding one single object being the parameter of
   interest (used to identify it from other nuisance parameters)
 - parameters: a RooArgList holding all nuisance parameters
   (used to know on which parameters, in addition to the POI, to
   perform the MCMC; the range of those variables define the range to
   use for the MC sampling)

The interface can be run with:

    ./runRooInterface WS_GaussOverFlat_withSystematics.root myWS

Using the default arguments would be similar to:

    ./runRooInterface bat_workspace.root myWS

More documentation, examples and maybe an undated version of BCRooInterface
might be available on the webpage:

RUNNING THE BATCalculator EXAMPLE
---------------------------------

The tutorial macro runBATCalulator.C can be be run via

    root -l
    .x runBATCalculator.C

Further explanations about the example can be found within the code.

It is possible to use the BATCalculator class within C++ programs by
making use of the BAT libraries .
