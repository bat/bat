For each of the problems, call the executable with an input file as an
argument. For example,

./runMyCombination input.txt

oneObservable:
--------------
Combination of three measurements of one observable.

constraints:
------------
Measurement of two fractions (observables) constrained to be in the
interval [0,1]. Includes goodness-of-fit test and ranking of
measurements and uncertainties.

nuisance:
---------
Combination of three correlated measurements of one observable with
one source of uncertainty.

inverseProblem:
---------------
An example with a physics model with two parameters.

PPP:
----
An example following Peelle's Pertinent Puzzle in Nucl. Sc. and
Eng. 170 (2012) 54.
