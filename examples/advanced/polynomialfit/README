This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed in the system.

The eample shows how to preperly define a new model class
based on the BCModel class or on any previously defined class
which inherits from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create
a simple compiled program using BAT.

In the example there are many of BAT features shown. The source
files contain plenty of comments and explanations.


The files:
----------

   Makefile       - makefile for the example program
   Pol1Asymm.h    - definition of a model class for straight line
                    fit with asymmetric errors
   Pol1Asymm.cxx  - soure code of the Pol1Asymm class
   Pol2Asymm.h    - definition of a model class for quadratic
                    fit with asymmetric errors
   Pol2Asymm.cxx  - soure code of the Pol2Asymm class
   asymmErrorsFitterExample.cxx
                  - source code of the main program
   CreateData.C   - a ROOT macro for creating the data to fit


Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

	For the compilation to work properly BAT needs to be installed
	in the standard system accessible location or in the path defined
	by the BATINSTALLDIR environmental variable.

3. Prepare the dataset to fit using the ROOT macro CreateData.C
   (e.g. by running root CreateData.C from the command line)

4. Run the executable 'asymmErrorsFitterExample'
