Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to properly define a new model class based on
the BCModel class or on any previously defined class which inherits
from BCModel. It demonstrates how to create a simple compiled program
using BAT.

It shows how to change the trial function for the MCMC. The actual
model is a simple 2D Gaussian.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations.

Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

  For the compilation to work properly, the script bat-config needs
  to be accessible, for example by adding its directory to the PATH
  environment variable.

3. Run the executable 'runTrialFunction'.
