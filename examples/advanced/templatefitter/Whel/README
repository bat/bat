Example on template fitting "W helicity":
=========================================

Motivation:
-----------
The physics motivation for this analysis is the extraction of the
fraction of right-handed W-bosons in top decays. Four templates are
fitted to a single histogram. Three different sources of systematic
uncertainty are taken into account. The source code is commented and
exaplains the individual steps. Three files are part of this example.

Files: 
------
CreateHistogram.C - this needs to be run first to generate the
                    templates and a data set. Feel free to modify the 
                    templates here. 

templatefit.C     - this macro performs a template fit to a single data
                    set

ensembletest.C    - this macro performs an ensemble test for a given
                    combination of templates.

How to run:
-----------
1) Create the necessary histograms for the example by running the
   macro CreateHistograms.C:

   root CreateHistograms.C

2) To perform an analysis on a single data set run the macro:

   root templatefit.C

3) To perform ensemble tests run the macro:

   root ensembletest.C
