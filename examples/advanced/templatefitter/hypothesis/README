Example on template fitting "hypothesis testing":
=================================================

Motivation:
-----------

The motivation for this analysis is to fit different models to a
histogram and compare the models. Each model has different number of
templates which are fitted to a histogram. The source code is
commented and exaplains the individual steps. Three files are part of
this example.

Files:
------
Makefile               - the Makefile

runHypothesisTest.cxx  - this macro performs a template fit to a single data
                         set for different models

histograms.root        - the file containing all templates and the data
                         histogram

How to run:
-----------
1) Create the executable:

   make

2) To perform an analysis on a single data set run the executable:

   ./runHypothesisTest
