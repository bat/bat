Description: 
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The motivation for this analysis is to fit different models to a
histogram and compare the models. Each model has different number of
templates which are fitted to a histogram. The source code is
commented and exaplains the individual steps. 

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:

                            fits to a single data set


Running the example:
