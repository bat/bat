Description:
------------

This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed on the system.

The example shows how to use the graph fitter which comes with BAT. It
fits four different functions assuming gaussian uncertainties. This
example represents the example from the BAT paper showing a comparison
between different fits.

The source file(s) contain(s) plenty of comments and explanations. For
further documentation see the "Short Introduction to BAT" and/or the
reference guide, both available on the BAT web page:
