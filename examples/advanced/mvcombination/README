This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed in the system.

The example calculates the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of
several measurements and observables according to Nucl.  931
Instrum. Meth. A500 (2003) 391 and numerically.

   runMyCombination.cxx   - example code how to run a combination
                            with a derived combination code (2D example)
   input.txt              - input file to 2D combination
   input2.txt             - input file to 1D combination

Input file structure:
---------------------
number of observables, measurements and source of uncertainty
list of observables and their (min/max) ranges
names of the uncertainties
list of measurements, observables, central values and uncertainties
list of correlation matrices

Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

	For the compilation to work properly BAT needs to be installed
	in the standard system accessible location or in the path defined
	by the BATINSTALLDIR environmental variable.

3. Make sure that the input file contains the corresponding
   information about the input values.

4. Run the executables 'runMyCombination.cxx' or 'runMVCombination.cxx'
