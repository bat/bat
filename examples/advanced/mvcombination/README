This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed in the system.

The example calculates the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of
several measurements and observables according to Nucl.  931
Instrum. Meth. A500 (2003) 391 and numerically.


The files:
----------

   Makefile               - makefile for the example program
   MVCombination.h        - definition of the combination model
   MyCombination.h        - definition of the concrete combination model
   MVMeasurement.h        - definition of a measurement
   MVUncertainty.h        - definition of an uncertainty
   MVCombination.cxx      - soure code
   MyCombination.cxx      - soure code
   MVMeasurement.cxx      - soure code
   MVUncertainty.cxx      - soure code 
   input.txt              - input file


Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

	For the compilation to work properly BAT needs to be installed
	in the standard system accessible location or in the path defined
	by the BATINSTALLDIR environmental variable.

3. Make sure that the input file contains the corresponding
   information about the input values.

4. Run the executable 'runMyCombination.cxx'
