This example is part of BAT. It will only run if BAT is correctly
installed in the system.

The example calculates the signal reference prior and posterior for a
counting experiment following JINST 7 (2012) P01012 [arXiv:1108.4270].


The files:
----------

   Makefile               - makefile for the example program
   ReferenceCounting.h    - definition of the counting model
   ReferenceCounting.cxx  - soure code of the counting class


Running the example:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system

2. Compile the example by running 'make' in the example directory

	For the compilation to work properly BAT needs to be installed
	in the standard system accessible location or in the path defined
	by the BATINSTALLDIR environmental variable.

4. Run the executable 'runReferenceCounting.cxx'
