The procedure to prepare compilation after checking out the package
from the svn repository is the following:

1. Run autogen.sh
   It will create the configure script as well as all Makefile.in files
   based on configure.ac and Makefile.am's
   
   In case autoreconf (v 2.64) complains about missing directory `config`:
   remove/comment out '-I config -I m4' from the command in the autogen.sh file.

2. Run ./configure
   It will prepare the compilation based on the system setup.
   See ./configure --help for configuration options

3. Run make to compile BAT

4. Run make install to install BAT
   Note: Occasionally problems occur when reinstalling BAT. Old files from previous
   BAT versions may persist. It is useful to remove all files in 
   $(BATDIR)/lib and $(BATDIR)/include before installing.


Preparing tarball for the release
---------------------------------
Only raise the version number just before making the tarball to be distributed
outside the comunity of developers. The version number has to be changed in the
following files:

configure.ac
README
INSTALL

When making the version for the public release also provide new release notes
(file doc/releasenotes.txt). In case the introduction.tex has also been updated
and is incompatible with previous releases, also change the version number there.

The changes in the configure.ac only take effect after running autogen.sh script
described above. To make the release tarball, run

make dist

which will create directory BAT-x.x where x.x is the vesion number. All needed
files will be copied into it and then the directory will be compressed (.tar.gz).

Important !!!
During the 'make dist' the whole 'examples' directory is copied. Therefore, prior
to running 'make dist' you have to make sure that none of the examples'
directories do not contains object or executable files makefile (the makefile.in
file should stay there) and also no files with results of running the example
(e.g. .log, .txt, .ps). Otherwise these will be disreibuted in the tarball. The
easiest thing to make sure this doesn't happen is to delete the whole 'examples'
directory and to restore it from the svn by running 'svn update examples'.
