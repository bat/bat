To create a tarball of a release in a current directory you have
to copy the Makefile and the removeCVS.sh to that directory and
run make. The file removeCVS.sh has to be executable.

You should set the path to the source of the BAT checked out from
CVS in the makefile (variable SOURCEDIR). You can also change the
version number (variable VERSION).

We have to change this procedure in the future...
